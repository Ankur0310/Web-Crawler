# Multi Threaded Web-Crawler

### Description
The goal of this project is to create a multi-threaded web crawler. A Web crawler is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing. Any search engine uses these indexes, web graphs, and an appropriate algorithm ( such as PageRank ) to rank the pages. The main focus of the project would be to implement a multi-threaded downloader that can download multi websites at the same time. The plan is to implement this in C or C++.
